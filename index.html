            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello, I'm Krish Patel! I am a freshman majoring in computer science at the University of Texas at Dallas.
            I am passionate about creating programs, problem-solving, and making projects. I have a large
            interest in the medical field; however, I enjoy all types of coding projects.
            I am currently still learning a lot, and I am very excited to progress my journey in the
            computer science field.</p>

            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <h4>Poker Analysis</h4>
            <p>Developed a program in C++ that used randomization techniques to simulate poker hands and analyze probabilities.
            With the ability of arrays, I was able to generate numerous amounts of poker hands
            and organize them into their respective category. In the process of creating this project
            I learned the use of randomization, arrays, and the use of complex logical operators.</p>
            <h4>One-time Pad</h4>
            <p>Built a C++ encryption program using a One-Time Pad cipher for secure data communication. 
            Reading files, static cast, and math were used to create this project. The program
            would read a file of completely random characters on the ASCII table, which would then be converted 
            to a message. Encryption and decryption are possible with this project.</p>

            <h3>Dallas Formula Racing at UTD</h3>
            <p>Contribute to software development for a competitive racing car. I currently am apart of the
            software team where I create programs that can assist in the functioning of a formula racing vehicle
            at UTD, which will participate in competitions in the near future.</p>
            <h3>BMES at UTD</h3>
            <p>Engage in discussions and research on biomedical engineering topics. I attend all meetings and learn
            about opportunities that may require engineering or software. I enjoy the medical side of engineering 
            and would enjoy being able to participate in a project where I can assist with the software side.</p>
